The bank swallows are found near water and nest on the ground. The bird spends the winter around the southern tip of Texas and migrates north to breed from New England to Alaska in late May or early June. They live in colonies, often mixed in with other species of swallow. Their favorite food is flying insects but they also eat spiders, bees, flies, grasshoppers, worms, snails and small mollusks.

The brewer sparrow is listed as endangered by the IUCN. It has been greatly reduced from historical numbers due to habitat loss. In the 1930s, it ranged widely across the Great Lakes region and northern United States and Canada. However, it currently only inhabits a narrow band stretching south from Lake Superior along the St Lawrence River as far east as Maine in northern North America.

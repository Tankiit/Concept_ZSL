How do we know when the lemur is on its way to extinction if we donâ€™t have an image of it alive? What can the Lemur Conservation Foundation do with these images? A: Images from citizen scientists are a valuable data point. Taking photos and videos of animals in their natural habitat gives us critical information about population size, ecology, range or behavior that we would not know otherwise. We use this information to better understand lemur biology, and make conservation decisions on what actions should be taken next to protect these species from extinction. These images also contribute to science and are used in research papers to study lemurs.

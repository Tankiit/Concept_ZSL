A: Most probably the most accurate answer is "I don't know yet". However, this means that you can use the questions above as hints, and then search for additional information on the topic. So it might be justified to ask them at least as a hint question. In any case, asking the question "are [species names] related" for multiple species is not recommended for two reasons:
1) There is no single answer that can be given for this kind of question - so why not search for information by yourself? It takes some time, but in the end it is probably more satisfying to do your own research and know more than just an isolated piece of knowledge. This has been explained in detail in the post "are [species names] related" questions.
2) This question makes a lot of assumptions about what "related" means. It assumes that all species in the same genus (e.g. cats, or dogs) are related to each other as one big family. But this is by no means always true. While most species within a genus are likely related to some degree, you often find species inside the same genus which do not share any common ancestor and therefore are not closely related at all. For instance, domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) are closely related to wildcats but less so to cheetahs or cougars (Panthera pardus).

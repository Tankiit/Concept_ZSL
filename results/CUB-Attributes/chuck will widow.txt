The most informative visual feature of the chuck will is his/her whiskers.
Another distinctive physical feature is the absence of eyebrows, as these mammals have follicles that produce hair directly on their skin (hairless). The chucks also possess a thick and soft dark fur. Furthermore, their eyes are large compared to other small rodents and they have an unusually long tail.

Sometimes the identification of an animal species can be tricky. It all depends on your experience level, and how much information you have about the animal. But even if you are an expert in animal species identification, there are many other factors to consider such as weather conditions, surrounding environment, and time elapsed since it was photographed! In other words, it is not easy to identify a photo of an animal. The following is my take on how I approach animal species identification when viewing photos.
What information do you have about the animals? Sometimes we can get lucky, and know where and when it happened. But even if you know nothing about where or what time you took your pictures, you must still start somewhere by narrowing down your search! The key to identifying an animal is to find common features that are useful information for classification (such as the fur color and pattern). But do not always rely on these visual features alone. There are other factors you should consider such as size of body parts, posture or behavioral cues like a tail wagging or bouncing around!

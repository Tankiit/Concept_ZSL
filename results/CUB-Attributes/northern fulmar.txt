A: The answer is yes. Here is what the camera sensor looks like with different types of digital cameras and film type. For example a DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) camera has a similar sensor to that of 35 mm movie film which was originally developed for motion picture shooting as well as using them for still photography.
A: We’ve been told by an expert there is no way they could’ve accurately dated the photo from it’s size alone and from their research, the best guess was that this species of octopus wasn't yet discovered. So sadly, due to the lack of information we cannot say for sure when this photo was taken but because this type of octopus wasn't discovered until 1954, our guess is this photo was most likely taken in the 1960’s or early 70’s!

How can you determine if something is alive?
There are many ways to tell if something is alive or not. If it is moving, then that would be one way to tell. Moving water animals like jellyfish and tadpoles will be alive. Plants move their leaves in the wind and sunlight to get more energy from the sun. Animals might also use movement for reproduction; some reproduce asexually while other have sex with another animal (with or without consent). If it has eyes, ears, nose, mouth and legs you can consider that the thing is alive. If it is eating, drinking, breathing and sleeping then maybe itâ€™s alive too!

There are two methods of animal ID, Visual Features and Species Expertise.
Visual features method: you will get the answer by picking useful visual feature from photos to tell what is an artic tern. This method is one of the best way for young children to learn animal identification because they can easily identify animals through their appearance, instead of learning about animal class or even using scientific name as a key to recognize each animal.
Use species expertise: you will get the answer if you are able to choose from the three choices (artic tern/tern-like bird). This method is suitable for adults who have at least one specialization about some group of animals, such as birds or mammals. If they are experts in a certain field, they can recognize an animal based on their expertise and knowledge in that field.
This website uses visual features approach to learn animals. So you will get the answer by picking useful visual feature from photos to tell what is an artic tern.

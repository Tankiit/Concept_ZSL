If you do not have much experience with birds, we recommend that you use AI technology. More about how to use it below.
Can you automatically distinguish lemurs from other animals in photos?
If you are unsure if the animal on a picture is actually a lemur, an AI-powered solution could be helpful. Imagine using Google Photos and getting some suggestions: "There's a lemur!" "Oh no! Thereâ€™s a tiger!"
AI tools use machine learning (ML) algorithms to recognize patterns in data. Such as pictures from the National Geographic database, where there are about 10 million photographs stored over time.
These AI tools can automatically detect all kinds of lemurs and other animals - so you will not need any experience with wildlife identification!
How to use AI for visual features identification?
Many AI-based solutions recognize objects in real-time (video streaming) or in photos, using deep learning algorithms. For example, Google Photos or similar apps can easily identify lemurs and other animals by asking you to give the name of the animal on a picture.
To make it easier for users to analyze their own images, we can recommend using AI-based solutions. Such as PicassoML.AI, that recognizes visual features automatically without having any experience with wildlife identification! For instance:
If you like, you can download your image by right-clicking on it and saving as a .png or jpeg file (you will need to sign up first). Then upload the images in PicassoML AI Studio or use our web app.

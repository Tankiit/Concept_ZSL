What is a lemur?
The lemurs are a clade of strepsirrhine primates endemic to the island of Madagascar. The group contains over 100 extant species. Lemurs range in size from the 30 g mouse lemur (Microcebus) to the 9 kilograms (20 lb) Indri, and are divided among 30 genera and at least 5 families:
Lemurs share many features with other primates such as haplorhine structure of their teeth. However they lack the hind limb and body hair typical of "higher" primates in ways that indicate a distinct evolutionary history, particularly from tarsiers (which are also strepsirrhines).
These are: all have clawed digits rather than the nails found in haplorhine primates; they are arboreal and nocturnal but not territorial or pack-reared as other primates are. The earliest lemurs diverged from tarsiers about 60 million years ago, though some scientists have argued that they may be a sister group of tarsiers rather than ancestral to them.
The origin of the name "lemur" is obscure. It was probably coined by Linnaeus in 1758 and then again by Lacépède in 1799, both referring to an animal mentioned in Ancient Roman writings called lemures.

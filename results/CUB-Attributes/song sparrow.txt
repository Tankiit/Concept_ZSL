A: The primary means of communication between humans is the spoken word. In humans, speech is characterised by the use of semantically significant vocables as an abstracting or generalizing device in order to express information and emotions regarding one's self or external entities such as other animals and objects. Writing, visual art, dance, music, theatre or other performance arts, and architecture are also important forms of communication in human society.

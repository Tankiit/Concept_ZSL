- blue and white wings with black tips, dark sides of head
- males have red eye patches; females have greenish eye patches

The above species are currently known as the only members of genus Syrrhopodon. They share some common traits, such as:
- bilaterally symmetrical bodies with two pairs of wings
- broad heads
- long beaks or rostrums
- two spiracles behind the head
- two sets of eyes
- large forked tail feathers (pectoral)
- two digits on fore and hind limbs
However, they are still different from each other in several ways. For example:
- A. aylmeri and S. wallacii have black beaks/rostrums, whereas those of S. arctica are pale grey; S. arctica also has dark eyes, while the others do not
- There is an overlap of wing length in Syrrhopodon (range 42â€“60 mm), but they differ from each other significantly overall: A. aylmeri and S. wallacii are rather robust whereas S. arctica and S. mirabilis are more slender
- All Syrrhopodon species have long tail feathers, which form V-shaped (forked) structures that resemble a kite; their wings extend beyond the tail tip in adults of A. aylmeri and S. wallacii, whereas those from S. arctica and S. mirabilis are much shorter
The plumage patterns of species within genus Melanitta also share some common traits, such as:
- Dark back, wings, and tail. The head is white in adults; this extends to the neck of young birds.
- White underparts with black streaks in the breast and flanks. The belly is mostly white except
- bright blue head, breast, wings (dusky brown below)
- long tail with a fan-shaped tip

- male has blue feathers with black wings
- female has olive-grey upperparts, white belly and throat, orange breast patches on chest, and blue tail feather spots

- 13 cm long, brown streaked with blue and purple
- male has red patch above the bill

- small bird with a blue head and yellow wings
- red bill
- long tail
- white under tail

- dark blue and turquoise plumage with black markings
- small crests on top of the heads; they will be raised when disturbed or excited
- yellow legs and feet

- blue, black, white, or yellow wings and upper body
- reddish-orange underbody

- blueish-green bird with yellow belly, red and black face mask, and white wing patches

- male with blue, black and white feathers (female does not have the blue plumage)
